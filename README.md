# Scripting

## Multi-Language Script Repository

This repository contains a collection of scripts developed in various programming languages, including Python, PowerShell, and more. These scripts are designed to automate common tasks, provide utility functions, and serve as useful examples for those learning these languages.

## Getting Started

To get started with these scripts, clone this repository to your local machine.

## Prerequisites

The scripts in this repository are written in multiple languages. You will need the corresponding interpreter or compiler for each language installed on your system. For example, to run Python scripts, you will need the Python interpreter.

## Usage
